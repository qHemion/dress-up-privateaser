In case of an accident/theft, Privateaser applies a 5000€ deductible.
<br/>

The booker can reduce the deductible amount from 5000€ to 200€ with a deductible option for a few more euros per person.
<br/>

The deductible
The booker is charged an additional 1€/person when he chooses the deductible reduction option.
<br/>

The additional charge goes to Privateaser, not to the bar.
